                <h2>How to Get Started with Warhammer</h2>

                <h3>Basics of Army Building</h3>
                <p>Whether you are building your first army or you just want to create a simple army for a quick match with your friend, creating a basic army is surprisingly easy. First, you and your opponent agree on how many points you are going to play with. You can theoretically play with any amount of points, but most battles typically range from 500pts for the smallest, and 3000pts for the largest. Second, you pick your faction from one of the numerous Warhammer has to offer, such as the green-skinned Orks, the robotic Necrons, or the shining Space Marines. After choosing your faction, you have another choice to make, which detachment you wish to play. If your faction is where you want your army to be from overall, then imagine your detachment as a more specific version of that. Each faction and each detachment for each faction comes with its own special rules, essentially buffs you get for your whole army. After picking a detachment, you now get to go into the meat and potatoes of building an army, selecting the actual units. Each unit is worth an amount of points, and you can include any number of units, so much as your total amount of points doesn’t exceed the amount agreed upon earlier by you and your opponent. After you have included all of the units you want and can afford, you then choose one of the units with the “Leader” tag to be your warlord, and you are done! Of course, this is only the most bare bones approach, and creating an army that actually has synergy is critical for achieving victory, but if you are learning for the first time or just want to have fun, this is all you need to do!</p>

                <h3>Advanced Army Building</h3>
                <p>Creating an army is easy. Creating an army that can stand up against the terrors of the 41st Millennium is much harder, but it can be done! First, you want to look in-depth at your faction and detachment abilities, seeing what you can build synergy off of. For example, T’au specialize at ranged combat, so you will want to choose units that enable you to keep your opponent at a distance, such as units with good range, while Khorne Daemons are full melee units, so you need to pick units that get them as close to your opponent as quickly as possible, such as units with a high movement speed or an ability to start the battle closer to your opponent. Next, you’ll want to consider your armies playstyle, do you want to play aggressive or defensive? Ranged or melee? Hit-and-run tactics, or a slow advancing wall of steel? Whatever you choose, you will want to pick units that augment this strategy, such as fast attack mounted units for offense versus slower moving heavy units for defense.</p>

                <h3>Physical Minatures vs Virtual Tabletop</h3>
                <p>When playing Warhammer 40K, there is typically a big distinction between playing in real life with physical miniatures and playing online with virtual miniatures, and there are advantages and disadvantages to both. With physical miniatures, you can paint them yourself, you can actually feel and touch the models, and it is generally much cooler to see it in person than through a computer screen. But it is also significantly more expensive, you have to paint them, and touching them can mess up the game. With virtual miniatures, you can play with people without being in the same room, everything is pre-painted, and you can play for the much more desirable cost of $0. But it has the disadvantages of not being able to choose how they are painted, the lack of ability to touch the miniatures, and the general loss of the “magic” of playing these games in the first place. There are players who play with both physical and virtual miniatures, so whichever camp you choose to call home, there will always be someone to play with!</p>
