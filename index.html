                <h2>About the Hobby</h2>
                <p>Miniature wargaming is a form of wargaming in which military units are represented by miniature physical models on a model battlefield. The use of physical models to represent military units is in contrast to other tabletop wargames that use abstract pieces such as counters or blocks, or computer wargames which use virtual models. The primary benefit of using models is aesthetics, though in certain wargames the size and shape of the models can have practical consequences on how the match plays out.</p>
                <p>Miniature wargaming is typically a recreational form of wargaming because issues concerning scale can compromise realism too much for most serious military applications.</p>

                <h2>About the Setting</h2>
                <p>Humanity stands on the brink of annihilation, as alien and heretic alike threaten the Imperium 
                    from every quarter. The waning years of the 41st Millennium are an age of constant war in which 
                    history, reason, and hope are ground to dust beneath the inexorable weight of the passing years. 
                    Enlightenment is replaced by superstition, understanding by rhetoric, rote, and blind prayer. 
                    War is all that remains.</p>
                <p>The opening of the Great Rift that rent the galaxy in two was preceded by an era of dark 
                    portents and momentous events. Seers and mystics went mad with fear – they raved about an 
                    unstoppable confluence of nightmares, of black storm clouds gathering to blot out the light of 
                    hope. It was a time of desperate heroics, of grand triumphs and bitter defeats, all turning 
                    about the inexorable wheel of fate.</p>
                <p>In the wake of that great calamity, Humanity faces existential threats from traitors, heretics, 
                    and xenos empires on all sides. Imperial defenders are stretched thin as they react to Ork invasions, 
                    the reawakening Necrons, the expanding T’au Empire, and worse. Into this maelstrom of conflict enters a 
                    threat long thought defeated – that of the Tyranid Hive Fleets. These hordes of ravening, ever-adapting 
                    lifeforms attack the Imperium from unexpected quarters – can Humanity’s warriors beat them back, or 
                    will the invaders forge a path to Holy Terra itself?</p>
